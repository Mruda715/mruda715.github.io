With everything that happen since Covid-19 started I had my own personal/family problems as well with my 5 other classes that I have taken this spring semester, I had a hectic schedule and I'm surprised I'm still going. The biggest challenge for this class was keeping up with all the new information, I definitely grew on the ability of processing information in a new way and it had benefited me in a way. In the time that I'm writing this I have fallen back with creating my portfolio site but I've allowed myself to take a break and reorganize everything so I know what I have to do and when I have to get it done.
Organization is a key skill that is important when coding, both away from it and engaging with it. Coding isn't easy and the help of other people is needed, especially if you're new to it. So keeping everything organized when viewing CSS/HTML is important for other people when trying to help solve a problem. As well with your future self, since it might make sense at the moment but a week later when you go to make changes you might not know what you did and why you did it.
